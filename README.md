Project Summary:

I've designed the report across three interactive pages:

Patient Summary Dashboard:This page provides insights into the hospital’s patient demographics and current status.

Key visuals include:

	Patient distribution by gender

	Patient status overview (e.g., Normal, ICU, Discharge, etc.)

	In-patient trends by department

	Slicers to filter data by department, patient type, and status

Hospital Summary Dashboard:

Here I focused on the hospital’s operational side.

KPIs displayed include:

	Total beds

	Occupied beds

	Average length of stay (LOS)

	Total revenue

	Staff count

 

I also visualized:

	Revenue by department

	Average ER time

	Patient feedback and ratings

	A LOS breakdown to monitor patient flow and efficiency

 

 Patient Details Page:

	This page offers a searchable, filterable table of all patients.Using synced slicers, users can filter by department, status, or gender — and instantly drill down into individual patient records.

 Features Used:

 

	DAX measures to calculate KPIs like occupied beds, average LOS, and revenue   

	Page navigation buttons for a user-friendly interface

    Sync slicers for cross-page filtering

	Custom visuals like donut charts, bar charts, and cards
