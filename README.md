# 🏥 Healthcare Analytics Power BI Dashboard

This project focuses on building an interactive healthcare analytics dashboard using Power BI. It visualizes patient data, hospital performance, and treatment outcomes to provide actionable insights for healthcare administrators, doctors, and policy makers.

## 📖 Project Summary

The report is structured across three interactive pages to provide a comprehensive view of hospital operations and patient insights:

## 1️⃣ Patient Summary Dashboard

Patient distribution by gender

Patient status overview (Normal, ICU, Discharge, etc.)

In-patient trends by department

Slicers to filter data by department, patient type, and status

## 2️⃣ Hospital Summary Dashboard

KPIs displayed: Total beds, Occupied beds, Average Length of Stay (LOS), Total revenue, Staff count

Visualizations include:

Revenue by department

Average ER time

Patient feedback and ratings

LOS breakdown to monitor patient flow and efficiency

## 3️⃣ Patient Details Page

Searchable and filterable table of all patients

Synced slicers to filter by department, status, or gender

Instant drill-down into individual patient records

## ✨ Features

Interactive dashboards with multiple pages and filters

DAX measures to calculate KPIs like occupied beds, average LOS, and revenue

Page navigation buttons for user-friendly interface

Sync slicers for cross-page filtering

Custom visuals: donut charts, bar charts, KPI cards

Dynamic filtering across departments, patient types, and statuses

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
